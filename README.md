# HR Analytics Dashboard

# HR-Analytics-Project
The HR Analytics project aims to enhance employee performance and retention through the development of an HR analytics dashboard using Microsoft Excel and Power BI. The dashboard is designed to provide valuable insights into employee data, enabling data-driven decision making to improve employee satisfaction and reduce costly attrition.

# Tools Utilized
* Microsoft Excel: For data cleaning, analysis, and initial visualizations.
* Microsoft Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and advanced data visualizations.

# Impactful Visualizations
* Donut Charts: To illustrate proportions of employee demographics and attrition trends.
* Area Charts: To visualize employee retention rates over time, identifying opportunities for intervention.
* Bar Graphs: To compare attrition rates across job roles, departments, and other key segments.
* Matrix: To display employee data in an intuitive grid format for easy comparison and analysis.
* Tree Map: To represent hierarchical employee data, such as attrition by job role and gender.
  
# Actionable Insights
* Educational Qualification: Employees with Life Sciences qualifications exhibited the highest attrition rates, warranting further investigation.
* Age Group: The 26-35 year old age group showed a notably high attrition rate, suggesting the need for tailored engagement strategies.
* Salary Impact: Employees earning up to Rs 5000 had a disproportionately higher likelihood of leaving, indicating a potential compensation gap.
* Tenure: Most employees who left did so after approximately one year of service, highlighting opportunities to enhance onboarding and early career support.
* Job Role Attrition: The roles with the highest attrition rates included Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists, requiring targeted retention efforts.
  
# Recommendations
* Compensation Review: Evaluate and adjust the salary structure, particularly for employees earning up to Rs 5000, to enhance competitiveness and reduce flight risk.
* Training and Development: Implement robust training programs to facilitate skill enhancement and career progression, boosting job satisfaction and retention.
* Supportive Culture: Foster a positive work culture emphasizing work-life balance, recognition, and empowering manager-employee relationships to drive engagement and loyalty.
